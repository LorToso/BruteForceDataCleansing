The given database has been cleaned, using  the following strategy:

1. Step: All non-numeric characters have been removed from the Zip-Code column, as a first attempt to generate more valid zip-codes
2. Step: The USPS Webside (https://www.usps.com/) provides a web-api with specific xml-masks, that returns corresponding City and State for given Zip-Codes.
		This tool has been used to generate the according data in the desired format (such as states represented by there two-letter abreviations)
3. Step: The USPS Website also provides a web-api, that takes in an address and returns the corresponding zip-code, together with an address representation
		in the format, that was defined in the given task. This tool has been used to clean up addresses and add zipcodes in records where no valid zipcode was given yet.
4. Step: All values have been mapped to uppercase, as it was specified in the given task.

Using this strategy, we where able to achieve a precision value of 0.8949 with a corresponding recall value of 0.9347. The implementation of the task has taken us approximately 10 hours.
